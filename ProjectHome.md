Chronoscope is a charting and visualization platform that excels at interactive time-series exploration in modern web browsers.    Much of the look and feel of charts can be controlled through CSS-inspired stylesheets or javascript APIs.

In modern browsers, Chronoscope uses the html canvas element.  For IE6,7,8 there's a Flash-based canvas fallback.

There's also a Java(GWT) API but most developers use Chronoscope via javascript + stylesheets.

Chronoscope's goals are:

  * Scalable: provide a high performance, cross browser platform for visualizing possibly large and complex  datasets.
  * Usable:  enable applications to be built using Javascript, HTML, and stylesheets, or in Java (GWT)
  * Stylish: controls over almost every aspect of the look and feel of a visualization
  * Customizable: extend with new plot types, new renderers, new canvas backends, etc.
